Simulations using Concorde TSP [link](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/gui/gui.htm)

TSP represents both process of connecting between newly-born neurons during axon-finding, or cliques within networks (fully-connected circuits).

* circuits that optimize the flow of information (non-recurrent). Can we modify TSP algorithm and/or model for recurrent network traffic? 

* combine TSP and Euler completeness to demonstrate how information can be efficiently transferred in a circuit. Do cliques or subnetworks of a certain size/configuration form an Euler complete graph? What is the shortest path across this graph? 

* use TSP as an alternative measure of network diameter: given a non-Euler complete circuit topology, what is the most efficient diameter across network. Still works for Euler complete circuits, although this diameter is known from the order of the Euler path.
