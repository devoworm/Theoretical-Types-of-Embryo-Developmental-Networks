Simulations using Concorde TSP [link](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/gui/gui.htm)

TSP represents both process of connecting between newly-born neurons during axon-finding, or cliques within networks (fully-connected circuits).

* circuits that optimize the flow of information (non-recurrent). Can we modify TSP algorithm and/or model?
