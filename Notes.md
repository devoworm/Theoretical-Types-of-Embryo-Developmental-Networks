Are there any papers on the morphogenesis of spatial networks?
1) concrete objects might help.

2) Physarum morphogenesis? Physarum --> circulation problem. How does this relate to TSP?


TSP solving:
1) recurrent networks or networks with a specific directionality?

2) TSP is about generating a cycle. Find a simpler problem --> minimize for a min Hamiltonian path (transmission of information and energy).

3) minimize costs of transport.

4) do biological systems use this type of circulation?


Hamiltonian path:
1) feedforward circuits do not need loops.

2) closed circuits = TSP. TSP --> sparse connectivity rules, chemical gradients, plasticity.

3) brain might be trying to minimize cost of transfer -- local optimality not important, but a global organizing principle.

4) is bidirectional communication possible?

5) biological systems with recurrence is important.


Do we understand the theoretical context?
1) can we introduce novel insight?
