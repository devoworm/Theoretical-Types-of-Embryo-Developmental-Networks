New World Networks are networks that expand as a result of a growth/reduction or differentiation/conversion process.

##### Key points:

* number of nodes grows or shrinks at each time point. Subsequent effects on the number and distribution of edges in the network.

* this has an effect on changes in connectivity at the subsequent time point.

* large-world networks: network expands faster than shortcuts can form. As a result, [small-world networks](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Small-world_network) can become disconnected.

* suggests mathematically-rigorous alternatives to [preferential attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment), which tends to reinforce hierarchies.
