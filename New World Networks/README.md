### Introduction

New World Networks are networks that expand as a result of a growth/reduction or differentiation/conversion process.

* new world networks are embryogenetc networks that expand according to a connectivity rule (e.g. preferential attachment).

Propose a few connection rules: 

1) developmental lineage proximity.

2) fellow sisters (sister cells).

3) common fate.

4) bilateral pairs (differentiation).

#### Key points:

* number of nodes grows or shrinks at each time point. Subsequent effects on the number and distribution of edges in the network.

* this has an effect on changes in connectivity at the subsequent time point. Also has an effect on routing strategies on network over time.

* large-world networks: network expands faster than shortcuts can form. As a result, [small-world networks](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Small-world_network) can become disconnected.

* suggests mathematically-rigorous alternatives to [preferential attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment), which tends to reinforce hierarchies.
