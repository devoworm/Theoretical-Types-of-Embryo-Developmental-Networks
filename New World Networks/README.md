### Introduction

New World Networks are networks that expand as a result of a growth/reduction or differentiation/conversion process.

* new world networks are embryogenetc networks that expand according to a connectivity rule (e.g. preferential attachment).

#### Propose a few connection rules: 

1) developmental lineage proximity.

2) fellow sisters (sister cells).

3) common fate.

4) bilateral pairs (differentiation).

#### Co-evolving networks: developmental connectome and embryogenetic network:

As the developmental connectome increases in size (number of cells) and diameter (shortest path across network), the embryogenetic network in the same organism shifts its connectivity or decreases in size (disconnection of differentiated cells, reconnection to newer developmental cells).

* we can work from the data in "[Data-theoretical Synthesis of the Early Developmental Process](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/282004v2)" to get a handle on the dynamics in _C. elegans_ development.

#### Key points:

* number of nodes grows or shrinks at each time point. Subsequent effects on the number and distribution of edges in the network.

* this has an effect on changes in connectivity at the subsequent time point. Also has an effect on routing strategies on network over time.

* large-world networks: network expands faster than shortcuts can form. As a result, [small-world networks](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Small-world_network) can become disconnected.

* suggests biologically-based and mathematically-rigorous alternatives to [preferential attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment), which tends to reinforce hierarchies.
