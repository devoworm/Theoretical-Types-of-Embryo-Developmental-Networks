Conventional Types of Complex Network:  
1. [Random Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_graph)  

2. [Scale-free Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network)  

3. [Small-world Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network)  

These types are based on degree distribution and the global patterns of connectivity. These types do not account for connectivity based on geometric or spatial constraints.  

Types of Spatial Networks:  
1. [Hyperbolic Geometric Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometric_graph)  

2. [Random Geometric Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_geometric_graph)  

3. [Planar Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph)  

Types of Topological Minimization:
1. [Steiner Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_tree_problem)  

2. [Dependency Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_network)  

3. [Interdependent Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdependent_networks)  

These types are defined by their ability to capture and reproduce geometric features and spatial dependencies. However, these are no clear relationships between spatial connectivity and scaling laws, particularly as they relate to biological processes.  

_In vivo_:  
We find a number of global patterns in embryo networks that do not conform with a typical mathematical model of connectivity. Some of these features have to do with differentiation, while others have to do with polarity and the geometry of the emerging phenotpye:  

1) spatial segregation by sublineage a few rounds of division after the founder cells appear for major sublineages. 

2) spatial diversification of sublineages over time.

3) spatial re-segregation of cells as tissues begin to form.

In embryo networks, so-called nodes are cells that are both small and have many immediate neighbors.
